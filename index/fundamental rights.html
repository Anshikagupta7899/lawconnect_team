            <h3>Let's know what is fundamental rights</h3>
            <p>Fundamental rights are the basic human rights enshrined in the Constitution of India which are guaranteed to all citizens. They are applied without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, gender, etc. Significantly, fundamental rights are enforceable by the courts, subject to certain conditions.</p>
            <h4>Why are they called Fundamental Rights?</h4>
            <p>These rights are called fundamental rights because of two reasons:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        They are enshrined in the Constitution which guarantees them.
                    </li>
                    <li>They are justiciable (enforceable by courts). In case of a violation, a person can approach a court of law.</li></ol>
            </p>
            <h4>How many Fundamental Rights are there in the Indian Constitution? </h4>
            <p>here are six fundamental rights in the Indian Constitution. They are mentioned below along with the constitutional articles related to them:
                <ol>
                    <li>Right to Equality (Article 14-18)</li>
                    <li>Right to Freedom (Article 19-22)</li>
                    <li>Right against Exploitation (Article 23-24)</li>
                    <li>Right to Freedom of Religion (Article 25-28)</li>
                    <li>Cultural and Educational Rights (Article 29-30)</li>
                    <li>Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32)</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h4>Why Right to Property is not a Fundamental Right?</h4>
            <p>There was one more fundamental right in the Indian Constitution, i.e., the right to property. 

                However, this right was removed from the list of fundamental rights by the 44th Constitutional Amendment. 
                
                This was because this right proved to be a hindrance towards attaining the goal of socialism and redistributing wealth (property) equitably among the people. </p>
